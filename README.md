# GoLogin

This is a package to manage user logins with go.

# Whats Next?

- Give verification emails an expiration
- Need to implement some TESTING (this is sooo late)
- Password reset
- Let users signin using email as well cause why not

# Stuff that was "What's Next" but is now more like "Doing/Done"

- User data stuff -> Json Web Jokens maybe?
